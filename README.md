# IURIS NATURALIS
A proof of personhoodâ€™s honor experiment based on honorable human interactions under natural law


# Description

Iuris Naturalis  is a fresh experiment on using personal honor in human interactions as a base of proof of personhod.
This system is developed by combining EAS attestations with IPFS, and smart contracts to solve onchain dispute resolutions.

The goal of Iuris Naturalis is to create a resilient decentraliced platform for individuals to make self-sovereign public attestations, by using a mechanism based on the fundamental concept of demonstrating honor tied to one's personhood and its rights in a group.

The DAP usses  EAS  attestations combined with IPFS,  simple onchain smart contract based on the greek klerotherion concept used to resolve honor disputes.
