# IURIS NATURALIS
# Brief
A proof of personhoodâ€™s honor experiment based on honorable human interactions under natural law


# Description


Iuris Naturalis  is a fresh experiment on using personal honor in human interactions. As experimental feature it introduces a fresh perspective on the value of personal honor in human interactions governed by natural law.
This system is developed by combining EAS attestations with IPFS, along with an easy onchain dispute resolution and a user-friendly IAM code form . 

The goal of Iuris Naturalis is to create a resilient decentraliced platform for individuals to serve self-sovereign needs like public attestations, all based on the fundamental concept of demonstrating honor tied to one's personhood.

The DAP usses  EAS  attestations combined with IPFS, and simple onchain smart contract based on the greek klerotherion concept used to resolve honor disputes.
